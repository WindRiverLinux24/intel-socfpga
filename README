For the supported kernel type for this BSP, please check the TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES
by running 'bitbake -e virtual/kernel | grep "^TARGET_SUPPORTED_KTYPES="'.

Note: The preempt-rt kernel type can be used with this BSP/Machine.

3. Board Specific Patches
=========================

To get a list of patches applied to the kernel specific to this BSP,
along with patch descriptions, use git to see what changed on the default
kernel (git whatchanged <kernel_type>..<bsp_name>). For example:

  # cd tmp-glibc/work-shared/<bsp_name>/kernel-source
  # git whatchanged v6.6/standard/base..v6.6/standard/intel-sdk-6.6/intel-socfpga


4. Boot Instructions
====================

The DTB file can be built automatically or you can generate it manually in a
single step.

To generate the DTB manually, change into build directory, then run the
following:

  # bitbake -c devshell linux-yocto
  For Stratix10 platform
  # make altera/socfpga_stratix10_socdk.dtb
  For Agilex platform
  # make intel/socfpga_agilex_socdk.dtb

The DTB can then be found in the

linux-<bsp_name>-<kernel type>-build/arch/arm64/boot/dts/altera
linux-<bsp_name>-<kernel type>-build/arch/arm64/boot/dts/intel

directory.

4.1 NFS Root File System
------------------------

Configure u-boot with target IP, tftp server, netmask and other required
network values in advance, and then run below commands.

For Stratix10 platform:
SOCFPGA_STRATIX10 # run fatscript
SOCFPGA_STRATIX10 # tftp 0x2000000 "/<tftp root>/Image"
SOCFPGA_STRATIX10 # tftp 0x8000000 "/<tftp root>/socfpga_stratix10_socdk.dtb"
SOCFPGA_STRATIX10 # run linux_qspi_enable
SOCFPGA_STRATIX10 # setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200n8 root=/dev/nfs rw \
			  nfsroot=<nfs server>:<nfs root>,nolock \
			  ip=<target IP>::<gateway>:<netmask>::eth0:off
SOCFPGA_STRATIX10 # booti 0x2000000 - 0x8000000

For Agilex platform:
Boot from SD card
SOCFPGA_AGILEX # run fatscript
Boot from NAND flash
SOCFPGA_AGILEX # run fpgaload

SOCFPGA_AGILEX # tftp 0x2000000 "/<tftp root>/Image"

Boot from SD card
SOCFPGA_AGILEX # tftp 0x8000000 "/<tftp root>/socfpga_agilex_socdk.dtb"
Boot from NAND flash
SOCFPGA_AGILEX # tftp 0x8000000 "/<tftp root>/socfpga_agilex_socdk_nand.dtb"

SOCFPGA_AGILEX # run linux_qspi_enable
SOCFPGA_AGILEX # setenv bootargs console=ttyS0,115200n8 root=/dev/nfs rw \
			  nfsroot=<nfs server>:<nfs root>,nolock \
			  ip=<target IP>::<gateway>:<netmask>::eth0:off
SOCFPGA_AGILEX # booti 0x2000000 - 0x8000000

4.2 Rootfs on MMC/SD
--------------------

An ext3/ext4 filesystem can be created on the MMC/SD using standard
techniques.

4.2.1 Deployment
----------------

After loading the kernel, pass kernel arguments like following:

    root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rw console=ttyS0,115200n8 rootwait

4.3 RAM Root File System
------------------------

4.3.1 Create initramfs image
----------------------------

Add below content in <project-path>/conf/local.conf.

	INITRAMFS_FSTYPES += "cpio.gz.u-boot"

Build the gzipped initramfs image with below command.

	# bitbake wrlinux-image-initramfs

The initramfs image is generated in <project-path>/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/intel-socfpga-64.

4.3.2 Deployment
----------------

After the BootLoader bootup, load initramfs, kernel and DTB:

	For Stratix10 platform
	# tftp 0x8000000 /<tftp root>/socfpga_stratix10_socdk.dtb
	For Agilex platform
	# tftp 0x8000000 /<tftp root>/socfpga_agilex_socdk.dtb
	# tftp 0x2000000 /<tftp root>/Image
	# tftp 0x5000000 wrlinux-image-initramfs-intel-socfpga-64.cpio.gz.u-boot

then you need to set initrd_high to restrict positioning of initrd ramdisk images:

	# setenv initrd_high 0x8000000

and then you need to pass the kernel arguments as follows:

	# setenv bootargs 'root=/dev/ram0 rw ramdisk_size=0x6400'

Boot kernel with the following command:

	# booti 0x2000000 0x5000000 0x8000000


5. Features Notes
=================

5.1 LWH2F Bridge
----------------
The pre-built SD Image allows you to test out the Lightweight HPS-to-FPGA (LWH2F) bridge on the Stratix10/Agilex SoC.
This bridge connects the Hard Processor System (HPS) to the FPGA core logic and can control FPGA IPs such as FPGA
LEDs and switches.

5.1.1 Known issue
-----------------
Stratix10/Agilex SOCFPGA doesn't support for controlling fpga bridge from linux kernel.
We can enable/disable fpga bridge in bootloader with command "bridge enable/disable"

5.2 HPS IO
----------
There are 3 LEDs on HPS IO48 OOBE Card that is a daughter card.
Run below command to turn on/off the 3 LEDs.
- To turn on/off HPS_LED1(D6):
root@intel-socfpga-64:~# echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/hps_led0/brightness
root@intel-socfpga-64:~# echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/hps_led0/brightness

- To turn on/off HPS_LED2(D8):
root@intel-socfpga-64:~# echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/hps_led1/brightness
root@intel-socfpga-64:~# echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/hps_led1/brightness

- To turn on/off HPS_LED3(D7):
root@intel-socfpga-64:~# echo 1 > /sys/class/leds/hps_led2/brightness
root@intel-socfpga-64:~# echo 0 > /sys/class/leds/hps_led2/brightness


6. Creating Partitioned Images(WIC)
===================================

You can use the OpenEmbedded Image Creator, wic, to create a properly
partitioned image on an SD card. The wic command generates partitioned images
from existing OpenEmbedded build artifacts.
For more information about WIC, see:

https://docs.yoctoproject.org/singleindex.html#creating-partitioned-images-using-wic

This BSP supports SD card disk images.
After building the project, you will have a WIC image under the directory
tmp-glibc/deploy/images/<bsp name>/, for example:

For Stratix10 platform
tmp-glibc/deploy/images/intel-socfpga-64/wrlinux-image-std-intel-socfpga-64.rootfs-stratix10-socdk-mmc.wic

For Agilex platform
tmp-glibc/deploy/images/intel-socfpga-64/wrlinux-image-std-intel-socfpga-64.rootfs-agilex-socdk-mmc.wic

You can then write the output image to an SD card.

6.1 Burn images to SD card
--------------------------

To burn u-boot and WIC images to an SD card, you need to execute below command:

For Stratix10 platform
# dd if=wrlinux-image-std-intel-socfpga-64.rootfs-stratix10-socdk-mmc.wic of=/dev/your_sd_dev

For Agilex platform
# dd if=wrlinux-image-std-intel-socfpga-64.rootfs-agilex-socdk-mmc.wic of=/dev/your_sd_dev

6.2 Boot up wic image
---------------------

Power on board, system boots up automatically from SD card.

Note:
There are 2 kinds of bootloader in the boot partition, u-boot.img and u-boot.itb.
u-boot.img: It is created only based on u-boot code.
u-boot.itb: It is created by combining u-boot with atf.
Use different bootloader, it is need to merge separate u-boot-spl-dtb.hex file into
FPGA image *.sof file. Detailed steps, please refer to below link:
https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683847/21-4/creating-configuration-files-from-command-94890.html
https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/docs/programmable/683389/21-4/creating-configuration-files-from-command-94890.html

7. Tickless Feature
===================
When Tickless Feature is required, please add it by template in setup command line
	--templates=feature/full_nohz


8. Update FPGA configuration file
=================================
8.1 On the target, copy FPGA configuration file(*.rbf) to rootfs/lib/firmware,
    and make sure the name of *.rbf file is soc_<s10/agilex>_fpga_config.rbf.
	For Stratix10 platform
	# cp xxx/ghrd.core.rbf /lib/firmware/soc_s10_fpga_config.rbf
	# cp xxx/socfpga_stratix10_fpga_update.dtb /lib/firmware/
	For Agilex platform
	# cp xxx/ghrd.core.rbf /lib/firmware/soc_agilex_fpga_config.rbf
	# cp xxx/socfpga_agilex_fpga_update.dtb /lib/firmware/

8.2 On the target, apply the overlay
	# mkdir /sys/kernel/config/device-tree/overlays/0
	# cd /lib/firmware/
	For Stratix10 platform
	# echo socfpga_stratix10_fpga_update.dtb > /sys/kernel/config/device-tree/overlays/0/path
	For Agilex platform
	# echo socfpga_agilex_fpga_update.dtb > /sys/kernel/config/device-tree/overlays/0/path

8.3 On the target, if you want to do programming again, delete the overlay first before doing step 8.2.
	# rmdir /sys/kernel/config/device-tree/overlays/0

Note1:
User can download the pre-build FPGA image or FPGA project from below link:
https://releases.rocketboards.org/release/2021.11/.
About how to build FPGA project and generate ghrd.core.rbf file, please refer to below link:
https://rocketboards.org/foswiki/Documentation/Stratix10SoCGSRD

Note2:
If there is any device running on FPGA side, please stop it firstly.

Note3:
For Agilex platform, we need disable fcs in u-boot to avoid fcs secure policy
block writing images to FPGA Manager:
	# fdt addr ${fdt_addr};fdt resize;fdt set /soc/firmware/svc/fcs status disabled;

9. Remote System Update
=======================

Please follow below steps to run remote system update feature

9.1 Install necessary tool
--------------------------
Please download below 2 tools from https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/downloads/download-center.html, linux version.
- Quartus Prime Pro Edition Programmer and Tools v21.3
- Quartus Prime Pro Edition Software v21.3
Note: Please apply for license for building Stratix10/Agilex *.sof file.
      Customer also can get the pre-build *.sof file from https://releases.rocketboards.org/release/2021.11/.

9.2 Setting up the build environment
------------------------------------
Start an embedded command shell
	# ~/intelFPGA_pro/20.4/embedded/embedded_command_shell.sh
Create the top folder used to store all the example files
	# rm -rf  ~/rsu_example
	# cd ~/rsu_example

9.3 Building hardware project
-----------------------------
Create a few images for testing: 0-factory, 1-production1, 2-production2, 3-production3
	# <path-to-quartus>/intelFPGA_pro/21.3/nios2eds/nios2_command_shell.sh
	# cd ~/rsu_example
	# rm -rf hardware_designs
	# mkdir hardware_designs
	# git clone https://github.com/altera-opensource/ghrd-socfpga.git
	# cd ghrd-socfpga
	# git checkout -b QPDS-21.3pro-21.1std QPDS-21.3pro-21.1std

	For Stratix10 platform
	# cp -r s10_soc_devkit_ghrd ../hardware_designs
	# cd ../hardware_designs/s10_soc_devkit_ghrd

	For Agilex platform
	# cp -r agilex_soc_devkit_ghrd ../hardware_designs
	# cd ../hardware_designs/agilex_soc_devkit_ghrd

	# make clean && make scrub_clean && rm -rf output_files
	# export IP_ROOTDIR=<path-to-quartus>/intelFPGA_pro/21.3/ip
	# make generate_from_tcl
	# make sof
	# cd ..

After building, there will be the following SOF files:
For Stratix10 platform
s10_soc_devkit_ghrd/output_files/ghrd_1sx280lu2f50e2vg.sof
For Agilex platform
s10_soc_devkit_ghrd/output_files/ghrd_agfb014r24b2e2v.sof

Note: For Agilex platform, set HPS_ENABLE_SGMII as 0 in below 2 files, because the sgmii feature needs special license on Agilex platform.
      agilex_soc_devkit_ghrd/Makefile
      agilex_soc_devkit_ghrd/board/board_devkit_make_config.inc

9.4 Building u-boot
-------------------

u-boot files for the 2 platforms(Stratix10&Agilex) are also built when building intel-socfpga BSP project, they will be in below directories.
For Stratix10 platform
<project dir>/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/intel-socfpga-64/socfpga_stratix10_mmc_defconfig
For Agilex platform
<project dir>/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/intel-socfpga-64/socfpga_agilex_mmc_defconfig
<project dir>/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/intel-socfpga-64/socfpga_agilex_nand_defconfig

9.5 Add FSBL to the SOF file
----------------------------
The SOF files generated by the Quartus tool only contain the FPGA fabric configuration,
and we need to add the FSBL to them with the following commands:
# cd ~/rsu_example
# rm -rf sof_files
# mkdir sof_files
For Stratix10 platform
# for version in {0..3}
  do
	quartus_pfg -c -o hps_path=<project dir>/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/intel-socfpga-64/socfpga_stratix10_mmc_defconfig/u-boot-spl-dtb.hex \
	hardware_designs/s10_soc_devkit_ghrd/output_files/ghrd_1sx280lu2f50e2vg.sof sof_files/ghrd_hps.$version.sof
  done
For Agilex platform
# for version in {0..3}
  do
	quartus_pfg -c -o hps_path=<project dir>/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/intel-socfpga-64/socfpga_agilex_mmc_defconfig/u-boot-spl-dtb.hex \
	hardware_designs/s10_soc_devkit_ghrd/output_files/ghrd_agfb014r24b2e2v.sof sof_files/ghrd_hps.$version.sof
  done

After building, there will be the following files generated:
~/rsu_example/sof_files/ghrd_hps.0.sof
~/rsu_example/sof_files/ghrd_hps.1.sof
~/rsu_example/sof_files/ghrd_hps.2.sof
~/rsu_example/sof_files/ghrd_hps.3.sof

9.6 Creating the Initial Flash Image
------------------------------------
1) Go to the folder ~/ and create a file named quartus.ini containing the following two lines:
PGM_ALLOW_MT25Q=ON
PGM_ALLOW_MX66U=ON
The above file will allow the Quartus tools to use the Micron MT25Q and Macronix MX66U devices.

2) Start the Quartus Programmer tool by running the "quartus_pgmw" command.
	# quartus_pgmw

3) Click File > Programming File Generator .. to start the Programming File Generator Tool.

4) Select the Device family to be Stratix 10/Agilex, and Configuration mode to be Active Serial x4.

5) Select the output file type as JIC, which is the format used by the Quartus Flash Programmer tool.
   Select the optiona .map and .rpd files to be generated. The .map file contains information
   about the flash layout. The .rpd file contains the full binary content of the flash, and is intended
   for external programmers. Change the Name to "initial_image".

6) Once the output type was selected, click on the Input Files tab.

7) In the Input Files tab click on Add Bitstream button, then browse to ~/rsu_example/sof_files/, select
   the file ghrd_hps.0.sof and click Open, ghrd_hps.0.sof is used to be the factory image. Do the same for
   the ghrd_hps.1.sof that is used to be initial production image.

8) After input file was added in the Input Files tab, click the Configuration Device tab.
   In the Configuration Device tab, click on Add Device, select the MT25QU02G in the pop-up window,
   then click OK. Once that is done, the window will show the default initial partitioning for RSU.

9) Select the FACTORY_IMAGE entry, and click the Edit… button. The Edit Partition window pops up.
   Select the Input file to be Bitstream_1 (ghrd_hps.0.sof). Change Address Mode to Block, because
   it is need to make sure that leave enough space for the biggest anticipated factory image.
   Set the End Address to 0x0090FFFF in order to reserve 8MB for the factory image. This end address
   was calculated by adding 16MB to the end of the BOOT_INFO partition. Click OK.

10) Select the MT25QU02G flash device in the Configuration Device tab by clicking it, then click the
    Add Partition button to open the Add Partition window. Leave the Name as P1 and select the Input
    file as Bitstream_2(ghrd_hps_1.sof). This will be the initial production image. Select the Page to
    be 1. It means it P1(initial production image) has the highest priority of all production images.
    Select the Address Mode as Block and allocate 16MB of data by setting Start Address = 0x01000000
    and End Address = 0x01FFFFFF.

11) Create another two partitions P2 and P3 using the same procedure as for the previous step, but set
    the Input file to None, leave Page unchanged (it does not matter for empty partitions).
    Select the Address Mode as Block and set the start and end addresses as follows:
	P2: Start Address = 0x02000000 and End Address = 0x02FFFFFF.
	P3: Start Address = 0x03000000 and End Address = 0x03FFFFFF.

12) Click Select … to select the Flash loader. The flash loader will become part of the JIC file and will
    be used by the Flash Programmer tool. Select the desired Device family and Device name as below:
	Device family: Stratix 10/Agilex
	Device name: 1SX280LU3/AGFB014R24B

13) Click on Generate button to generate the initial flash image as ~/rsu_example/initial_image.jic and
    the map file as ~/rsu_example/initial_image_jic.map.

14). Click on File > Save As .. and save the file as ~/rsu_example/initial_image.pfg. This file would be
     useful later, if it is need to re-generate the initial image, only one below command can generate it.
	# quartus_pfg -c initial_image.pfg

9.7 Create Remote Update Production Image
-----------------------------------------
The RSU Production Images is able to be created from the Programming File Generator GUI tool, but the easiest
way is to create them via below commands.
	# cd ~/rsu_example
	# rm -rf image_files && mkdir image_files
	# for version in {0..3}
	  do
		quartus_pfg -c sof_files/ghrd_hps.$version.sof image_files/ghrd_hps.$version.rpd -o mode=ASX4 -o start_address=0x00000 -o bitswap=ON
	  done

The following files will be created:
~/rsu_example/image_files/ghrd_hps.0.rpd
~/rsu_example/image_files/ghrd_hps.1.rpd
~/rsu_example/image_files/ghrd_hps.2.rpd
~/rsu_example/image_files/ghrd_hps.3.rpd

9.8 Building ZLIB
-----------------
The ZLIB is required by LIBRSU and it is also built when building intel-socfpga BSP project.
It will be in directory <project dir>/build/tmp-glibc/work/cortexa53-wrs-linux/zlib 

9.9 Building LIBRSU and RSU Client
----------------------------------
The LIBRSU and the example client application are also built when building intel-socfpga BSP project.
They will be in directory <project dir>/build/tmp-glibc/work/cortexa53-wrs-linux/intel-rsu

9.10 Building the SD Card Image
-------------------------------
The bitstream containing the FPGA image and the FSBL is stored in flash,
but the SSBL(u-boot.itb), kernel image, dtb and rootfs will be stored in SD card.
The SD card images(wic files) are also built when building intel-socfpga BSP project.
For Stratix10 platform
<project dir>/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/intel-socfpga-64/wrlinux-image-std-intel-socfpga-64.rootfs-stratix10-socdk-mmc.wic
For Agilex platform
<project dir>/build/tmp-glibc/deploy/images/intel-socfpga-64/wrlinux-image-std-intel-socfpga-64.rootfs-agilex-socdk-mmc.wic

Note:
The Remote Update Production Images(ghrd_hps.0/1/2/3.rpd) need to be copied into rootfs manually.

9.11 Burn the initial image into qspi nor-flash
-----------------------------------------------
For Stratix10 platform
1) Make sure to insert qspi nor-flash card onto the S10 SoC Development Kit, connect with J14.

2) Configure the S10 SoC Development Kit DIP switch as follow, and then power on board.
	SW1: 1:OFF, 2-8:ON

15. Bootloader
==============

15.1 Introduction
-----------------

Now, there are 2 kinds of bootloader mode supported on aarch 64 socfpga platform.
Legacy mode: spl+u-boot, bootrom loads spl, and then spl loads u-boot.
ATF mode: spl+atf+u-boot, bootrom loads spl, and then spl loads bl31, and then bl31 loads u-boot.

Intel recommends customer to use the ATF mode for common aarch64 platform.
Now ATF mode is enabled by default in the current supported u-boot.

15.2 Known issue
----------------

15.2.1 CPU OFF/ON Limitation

When using u-boot v2021.07 ATF mode, there is a limitation of cpu off/on feature.
The cpu0 doesn't support off/on operation, otherwise it causes board reset.
Therefore, creating a patch in kernel to remove the online file interface of cpu0
to avoid board reset even if there is a mistake operation to cpu0.

15.3  Build U-Boot
------------------

By default, the u-boot image is compiled and installed. If you want u-boot to be manually
compiled separately, use the following command：

        # bitbake u-boot-socfpga

16. Boot System From NAND Flash(Agilex only)
============================================

Please follow below steps to implement booting system from NAND flash.

After burning all the images into NAND flash, power off board.

16.8.7 Disable JTAG
-------------------

Set SW1 as below status.

SW1: ON-OFF-OFF-ON

16.8.8 Boot System From NAND Flash
----------------------------------

Power on board, system will boot up from NAND flash.


17. suspend/resume
==================

Both Stratix10 and Agilex platforms don't support for deep level suspend, because they all don't
implement system suspend both in legacy and atf mode bootloader. So, they can only enter idle level.
Detail example as below, using serial to wakeup system.

	# echo s2idle > /sys/power/mem_sleep
	# echo enabled > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/dw-apb-uart/ffc02000.serial/tty/ttyS0/power/wakeup
	# echo mem > /sys/power/state
	system enter suspend status
	press any key to wake up system

Note: add no_console_suspend in bootargs if using serial to wakeup system.

18.FPGA crypto service(FCS)(Agilex7-F MMC only)
===============================================

18.1 Build FCS images
---------------------

To enable FCS feature, please add the following configuration parameter when setup project:

    --template=feature/intel-fcs

The required tool for FCS feature is Quartus, refer section 9.1 to install it to your build server
and apply the correct License for it, the recommended version is "23.2", which aligns with GHRD version,
After that, specify Quartus shell through "QUARTUS_SHELL" in conf/local.conf

	QUARTUS_SHELL = "[Quartus-install-dir]/23.2/nios2eds/nios2_command_shell.sh"

Build image directly by running:

	bitbake wrlinux-image-std

After that, you will find fcs wic image in below path, write it to mmc card directly with "dd" command.

	tmp-glibc/deploy/images/intel-socfpga-64/wrlinux-image-std-intel-socfpga-64.rootfs-agilex-socdk-vab-mmc.wic

You can also use you own keys to sign images through "FCS_KEY_DIR" in conf/local.conf,
it specifies where the key files are stored. If "FCS_KEY_DIR" is not specified, you will find the default key
in:

tmp-glibc/fcs_keydir/
├── root0.pem
├── root0_public.pem
├── root0.qky
├── sign0_cancel1.qky
├── sign0.pem
├── sign0_public.pem
├── software0_cancel3.qky
├── software0.pem
└── software0_public.pem

18.2 Build and flash FPGA images
--------------------------------

FPGA images can be built from GHRD(golden hardware reference design), you need to get the License
from Intel, so you need to build it manually by adding below parameters in conf/local.conf:

	BB_NO_NETWORK = '0'
	CUSTOMER_RECIPES:intel-socfpga += 'ghrd-socfpga'

Then run:
	bitbake ghrd-socfpga

Once it is done, you will get four fpga images in:

tmp-glibc/deploy/images/intel-socfpga-64/agilex_soc_devkit_ghrd/
├── ghrd_agfb014r24b2e2v.sof
├── signed_bitstream_core.rbf
├── signed_bitstream_hps.rbf
└── signed_flash.jic

You can run below command in JTAG mode to flash it to board to have a test, this way data will lost when board is reset.

	quartus_pgm -c 1 -m jtag -o "pi;root0.qky" && quartus_pgm -c 1 -m jtag -o "p;signed_bitstream_hps.rbf"

If all things works well, you can flash .jic file to board for long term use:

	quartus_pgm -c 1 -m jtag -o "pvi;signed_flash.jic"

18.3 FCS Verification
---------------------

After boot into system, run below command to have a test:

	# fcs_client -G prov-data.txt -p
	ioctl return status=0
	W0:Provision Status Code: 0x0
	W1:Key Cancellation Status: 0x1F
	W2:Co-Sign Status:          0

	C2:SVN Counter Value0: 0x0
	Service Root Key #1 Fuse Status: 0x1
	Service Root Key #0 Fuse Status: 0x1

18.4 Notes
----------

1) If key files are changed, FPGA images, uboot, kernel and kernel dtb are needed to re-sign and re-create,
and deploy them to board again.
