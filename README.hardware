3. BSP Features
===============

3.1 Supported Features
======================

The following BSP features are validated and supported on boards where
the corresponding h/w features exist.

 o General Platform
    + perf: H/W based PMU

  o Bus
    + I2C: Five I2C controllers, DesignWare APB I2C controller (DW_apb_i2c)
    + SPI: Synopsys DesignWare Synchronous Serial Interface (SSI) controller (DW_apb_ssi)
    + PCIe: A Gen3x8 Capable Root Port from FPGA side.(stratix10 only)

  o Network
    + Ethernet: Three 10/100/1000 Ethernet media access controls (MAC) with integrated DMA
		The EMACs are instances of the SynopsysDesignWare Universal Ethernet MAC
		Two SGMII RJ45 ethernet ports based on FPGA hardware design(stratix10 only)
		One SGMII RJ45 ethernet ports based on FPGA hardware design(Agilex only)

  o USB
    + Two USB On-the-Go (OTG) controllers with DMA.
    + Synopsys(â€ )DesignWare Cores USB 2.0 Hi-Speed On-The-Go (DWC_otg) controller

  o Storage
    + SD/MMC: DesignWare High-Speed SD/MMC controller
    + Nor flash: n25q00
    + NAND: CadenceDesign IP NAND Flash Memory Controller(Agilex only)

  o Misc Devices
    + UART: Two DesignWare controllers, based on an industry standard 16550
                 Synopsys DesignWare APB Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (DW_apb_uart) peripheral
    + GPIO(HPS): Synopsys DesignWare APB General Purpose Programming I/O (DW_apb_gpio) peripheral
    + GPIO(FPGA): FPGA SW3, FPGA button and FPGA led
    + QSPI: Quad-SPI flash controller based on Cadence Quad SPI controller
    + RTC: DS1339 based on I2C(stratix10 only)
    + DMA: On-Chip ARM Corelink DMA Controller (DMA-330)
    + FPGA I/O
    + EEPROM: atmel,24c32(stratix10 only)
    + Temp: maxim,max1619(stratix10 only)
    + ADC: ltc2497(stratix10 only)
    + Watchdog: Synopsys DesignWare APB Watchdog Timer
    + FPGA manager
    + Remote System Update
    + Memory ECC

3.2 Unsupported Features
========================

The following features are not supported and not validated:

    x HSMC interface

3.3 Known Issues
================

1) Network performance will reduce after flood ping on both Stratix and Agilex board,
   This will happen on both rgmii and sgmii mode, a work-around for this issue is to
   add stmmaceth=chain_mode:1 to boot command line when boot.

2) CPU hotplug feature doesn't support for stopping CPU0, only CPU1~3 are able to be
   disabled and enabled.

3) When attempting to read from or write to a USB device operating in 'High speed
   (480-Mbps)' mode, input/output errors may occur. As a workaround, adjusting the
   maximum speed to 'Full speed (12-Mbps)' in U-Boot can help alleviate this issue.

   # fdt set /soc/usb@ffb00000 maximum-speed full-speed
